Hilfswerk International

As a charitable organization Hilfswerk International has been implementing emergency relief projects, humanitarian aid and sustainable development projects in third world countries around the world. One example is the construction of women shelters and birth houses in Mozambique to reduce maternal and child mortality.

The project will analyze a collection of articles to understand, on scale, which companies and organizations are supporting what kind of projects in which regions around the world. This will enable a targeted approach to fundraising efforts.
