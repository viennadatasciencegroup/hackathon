gruenstattgrau project description

The non-profit portal gruenstattgrau is a knowledge management platform focused on urban greening. With the consideration for climate change, water management and air pollution the competency center aims to promote the development of green rooftops, facades and urban farming. 

This project focuses on text analysis of literature in the subject matter (magazines, websites, blogs, â€¦) to understand the geographical distribution of urban greening projects, as well as the development of topics over time, including public perception based on press releases. The outcome will be used to better understand where and how support is needed and what to focus on for the highest impact.
